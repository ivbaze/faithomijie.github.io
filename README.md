# San Francisco Airport Flight Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview

In this project, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze flight data from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) for March 2020. The goal was to uncover key insights into flight operations during that month by answering five important questions about flight volume, busiest days, and routes. I used visualizations to present findings in a clear and actionable way, making the data more accessible for decision-makers.
