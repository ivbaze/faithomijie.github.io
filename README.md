# San Francisco Airport Flight Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview

In this project, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze flight data from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) for March 2020. The goal was to uncover key insights into flight operations during that month by answering five important questions about flight volume, busiest days, and routes. I used visualizations to present findings in a clear and actionable way, making the data more accessible for decision-makers.

### Key Insights Uncovered:

<b> What is the total number of flights in March 2020? </b>

A single KPI (Key Performance Indicator) visualization was used to display the total number of flights for March 2020 at SFO. This provides a high-level overview of flight activity during the month.

<b> What is the busiest day at SFO in March 2020? </b> 

Using a line chart, I identified the day with the highest flight volume, highlighting when SFO experienced peak activity. This visualization helped pinpoint trends across the month.

<b> What are the total number of flights per day in a month? </b>

I further broke down the total number of flights per day by providing a detailed view of day-to-day fluctuations in flight activity, which could be useful for resource planning or operational insights.

<b> What are the Top 10 busiest flight routes? </b>
A bar chart was used to visualize the top 10 busiest flight routes from SFO, offering a clear understanding of which destinations were most in demand during the month.

Top 10 Longest Flight Routes
Another bar chart showcased the top 10 longest flight routes by distance, revealing key international or long-haul routes, essential for understanding the scope of SFO's global connections.
